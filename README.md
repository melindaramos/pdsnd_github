I used the practice problem sets code to help generate the load_data function.

I used this stack overflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/775049/how-do-i-convert-seconds-to-hours-minutes-and-seconds
    to show me how to format seconds into days, hh:mm:ss format using datetime package.

I used this link; https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.html#pandas.DatetimeIndex
    to learn how to extract hour or day of week info from a timestamp in dataframe.
